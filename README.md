# Design-of-16x8-Stack-Memory-
This project focused on the development and implementation of a stack memory module using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL).  The stack, designed with configurable depth and data width, supports essential operations like push, pop, and reset, functioning in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.
